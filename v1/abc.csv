Angy DaoDao,"Thank you for this course~ 

I do have a problem dealing with the first exercise. I‚Äôll be extremely appreciate if you have some time to answer my question.

I was using the same way as you did in the video, however, it keeps telling me that there is an error which the Table sys.products doesn‚Äôt exist. I tried my best but still didn‚Äôt work out. 

If I specifically choose the Schema sql_inventory or sql_store, it works. But I am not pretty sure if that‚Äôs all the products in the database, cuz I couldn‚Äôt choose both of them.

Hope to receive from you soon~
Many thanks.",2022-04-17T00:24:17Z,0,

Robin Frankham,"I've come across an anomaly that I can't get my head around... can anyone give a reason for this.

At 3.10.18 in the tutorial there is an exercise concerning the 'ORDER BY' statment.

If I write the query as :

1 SELECT * 
2 FROM order_items 
3 WHERE order_id = 2
4 ORDER BY quantity * unit_price 

I get records with product_id 6, 4 & 1 in that order - (ascending order)

If I write the query as :

1 SELECT * 
2 FROM order_items 
3 WHERE order_id = 2
4 ORDER BY quantity * unit_price DESC

I get records with product_id 1, 4 & 6 in that order - (descending order) - So far so good

If I write:

1 SELECT *, quantity * unit_price as 'Total Cost'
2 FROM order_items 
3 WHERE order_id = 2
4 ORDER BY  'Total Cost' DESC

I get records with product_id 1, 4 & 6 in that order - (descending order) - again fine

If I write:

1 SELECT *, quantity * unit_price as 'Total Cost'
2 FROM order_items 
3 WHERE order_id = 2
4 ORDER BY  'Total Cost'

I still records with product_id 1, 4 & 6 in that order - (descending order) - Aargh!... Surely, line 4 should cause the result to be in ascending order?

Am I doing something wrong? If so what?... is this an anomaly in SQL? If so, are there any others I should know about?

I am only 20 or so minutes in and realise I really want to make my own tables and database based on those. Do you have a video on creating tables that I can use in my own project? I mean I want to see how you made the tables and things that we download. Thanks Bryan,2022-03-17T18:02:10Z,0,0
